# doomStyleFPS

this is a doom style first person shooter game coded completely from scratch. It uses the windows console
  as the screen buffer. It implements some optics concepts to create a pseudo 3D experience
  It was created following Javidx9's follow-along coding videos. However, I made some modifications
  here and there following my own understanding of how the code works, my own preferance and for optimization
  purposes
